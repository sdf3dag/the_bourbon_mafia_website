            <p class="lead">At various times of the year, members of The Bourbon Mafia will visit distilleries to select
                that special barrel of bourbon that will be
                bottled, and enjoyed by the group. Most selections are from single-barrels, sourced for their unique,
                one of a kind personality.
                Each process is a little different, but every one of them is fun to take part in.
                In addition to selecting your personal bourbon, every distillery offers a personalized tour of their
                facilities if you travel there for the selection.</p><br><br>
